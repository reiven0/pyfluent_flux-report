## Prerequisites

- This script is designed to be used with a Workbench parameter set, executed from the Table Design Point.
- The script has been tested on 2024R2.03.
- The intermediate analysis files are saved to a path like 'A:\Temp\multi_surface_test@Fluent\cylinder01_files\dp0\FLU\Fluent'.
  The result_folder is created in the parent directory three levels up from the above path (cylinder01_files), and the CSV file is saved there.
- The DP (Design Point) number is extracted from the above path and added to the beginning of the file name.
ã€€(For example, dp0_output.csv)
